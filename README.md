# JAVA-Fish-Simulator
This is a fish simulator environment completed with controls to alter predator and prey attributes such as their speed, energy level, and size. Selected animal can display additional info such as their position on the sketch. The fish and predator themselves have their own pathing behavior such that they would target the optimal food source base on size and distance.
